# AoC2022
Simple repository to store my attempts at 2022's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Disclaimers
I chose to try some AoC challenge, and to write them in Rust to familiarize myself with the langage: the solutions and uses of the langage may be correct at most, but every day is provided as-is and is not intended as reference
